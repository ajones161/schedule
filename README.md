# Schedule

Just a small, ugly, fast little set of pages that keep track of the local weather around the college (on the landing page), read a json based on the page title and push the json data into a grid (on the schedule pages), and then check the time and highlight the corresponding class tile (also on the schedule pages). Now with a page for bus schedule pdfs.
