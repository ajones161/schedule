# Schedule

Just a small, ugly, fast little set of pages that keep track of the local weather around the college (on the landing page), read a json based on the page title and push the json data into a grid (on the schedule pages), and then check the time and highlight the corresponding class tile (also on the schedule pages). 

Current plans are: 
  - Make the schedule pages look nice on mobile.
  - Make the homepage not just a single link.
